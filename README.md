The Chaos Game is a mathematical method of generating fractals. This project is a visualiser for the Chaos Game which allows you to change the settings and see the results in real time. It is hosted at [https://chaos.danielhoward.me](https://chaos.danielhoward.me) The inpiration behind this was wanting to see how different shapes would appear when used in the Chaos Game.

For information about how to use the visualiser/chaos game, see [the help page](https://chaos.danielhoward.me/#help). A changelog for this project can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Toffee1347/chaos-game/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
